# About Katzenjammer

Katzenjammer is a card game that can only be described as a a cosmic gumbo of Uno, Truth or dare, and a misinterpretation of how Yu-Gi-Oh works. Oh, and it also uses Augmented Reality for some reason.

## How it work
Players take turns selecting cards from their hand in a high risk betting match until the game is over or a card prompts a dare. Since each card corresponds to a dare, the player wants to have as few cards in their hand as possible.

Unlike similar card games, where the dares on the cards are soft to avoid liability, we put the responsibility on our players to not kill themselves.

Each card contains a marker that reveals the dare when viewed through a custom mobile app using AR. All dares are input by the players, so the stakes are as high as your friends' respect for your dignity is low.  Players do not know what dare is on each card, but know the severity based on card color.

The deck is made up of cards containing dares and action cards, which either help to eliminate cards from your hand, force you to draw more cards, or perform dares.
Each player also gets two **MONSTER CARDS** - which can be used throughout the game  to screw over opponents or protect you from nasty dares.

Once the deck is empty and the game is over, all players must read the cards left in their hand and perform the dares on them, resulting in embarrassment and second-hand embarrassment.

If you like card games and aren't slick enough to peer pressure your friends into doing dumb stuff, please consider helping us bring this game to life.




# About Katzenjammer Games Ltd.
Katzenjammer Games is an indie game studio based in Edmonton, Alberta that seeks to combine the social interaction of tabletop cards games with Augmented Reality to create new unique social experiences for our users.

The company’s sole project (for now…) is its card game of the same namesake: **Katzenjammer!**

 The idea for this project sprung up from the initial pandemic lockdowns in March 2020, during which the Katzenjammer team spent its free time learning to develop AR and mobile apps.


**Please note:** This project is in early development and there will be much more information available soon!
