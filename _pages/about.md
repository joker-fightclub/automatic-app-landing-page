# About Katzenjammer Games Ltd.
Katzenjammer Games is an indie game studio based in Edmonton, Alberta that seeks to combine the social interaction of tabletop cards games with Augmented Reality to create new unique social experiences for our users.

The company’s sole project (for now…) is its card game of the same namesake: **Katzenjammer!**

Katzenjammer Games is run by Ryan, who works full time as a data scientist and engineer. The idea for this project sprung up from the initial pandemic lockdowns in March 2020, during which Ryan spent his free time learning to develop AR and mobile apps.


**Please note:** This project is in early development and there will be much more information available soon!
