# About Katzenjammer

 Katzenjammer is a one-of-a-kind card game that blends the excitement of Uno, Truth or Dare, and Yu-Gi-Oh. The game is played using a deck of cards that contain dares and action cards, with a unique twist - the dares are created by the players themselves.


## How it works

In Katzenjammer, players take turns selecting cards from their hand in a high-stakes betting match. Each card corresponds to a dare, the severity of which is indicated by its color. However, the players don't know what the dare is until they use a custom mobile app with Augmented Reality to reveal it.

What sets Katzenjammer apart is that the dares on the cards are input by the players using a companion app. This means that the stakes are as high as your friends' respect for your dignity allows, and the embarrassment factor is off the charts.

One of the unique features of the companion app is the ability to create different collections of dares, also known as dare decks. This allows the game to never get stale, and it can adapt to different playing scenarios. For example, you could have a dare deck for a relaxing Friday night with friends or one specifically tailored to a camping trip, with dares that take into account the outdoor environment.

Each player starts with two **Monster Cards** that can be used throughout the game to sabotage opponents or protect themselves from the consequences of the dares. The game ends when the deck is empty, and players must perform the dares on the cards left in their hand.

Katzenjammer is a hilarious and interactive card game that will have you and your friends laughing, cringing, and having a great time. Get ready for the ultimate player-driven game night!

## About Katzenjammer Games Ltd.
Katzenjammer Games is an indie game studio that seeks to combine the social interaction of tabletop cards games with Augmented Reality to create new unique social experiences for our users.

The company’s sole project (for now…) is its card game of the same namesake: **Katzenjammer!**

The idea for this project sprung up from the initial pandemic lockdowns in March 2020, during which the Katzenjammer team spent its free time learning to develop AR and mobile apps.


**Please note:** This project is in early development and there will be much more information available soon!
